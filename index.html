            Born and raised in rural New Zealand, I now call Melbourne home. I'd always considered school to be little more
            than a place to eat lunch and play sport, but recalling those rare
            moments of focus in the classroom, I remain indebted to an
            English teacher who encouraged me to write and write often.<br /><br />
            Now, in a working life which has encompassed the full gamut,
            from the shearing shed to an abattoir floor, in small business, to
            executive management at a global Fortune 500 company, and being at
            the ground floor of an exciting dental tech start-up, I am fortunate
            enough to be able to pursue a writing career. <br /><br />
            That this comprises two discrete audiences is perhaps unusual, but
            whatever the trigger for you visiting this site, please feel free to
            explore the 'other side' of my writing; whichever one that may be. I
            am extremely appreciative of all those who helped me become
            established as a rugby writer, and likewise for everyone who
            continues to support my fiction writing. But most of all I want to
            thank my readers: time is valuable and the fact that you have chosen
            to give some of yours over to my writing is humbly and warmly
            acknowledged.

            " It was beer for the rousies too. Perhaps the bourbon would come
            out later; truth serum as Carl described it. For her size, Crystal
            could put the beer away. Sheâ€™d grown up in a drinking household,
            telling stories of her and her brothers and sisters, not even at
            high school yet, finishing off the leftovers after the adults had
            flaked out, the strains of popular local artist Prince Tui Teka
            fading into the night sky. Aping their parents and their friends,
            stumbling around acting drunk. Until they actually were."

            " No matter the conviviality among the players, the vibrant
            positivity that permeated the atmosphere a week ago has been drained
            from the building. Conversations are fewer. Softer. Less animated.
            Already, the office is looking sparse in places, untidy in others: a
            classic case of a tenant in the midst of sorting through their shit,
            packing and moving on. The Weary Dunlop Shield sits on a bench in
            the kitchen, alongside a tray full of plastic tomato and bar-b-que
            sauce bottles. The sauce will be divided amongst staff; nobody is
            quite sure what to do with the shield."
