            Born and raised in rural New Zealand, today I call Melbourne home. A
            fair few years ago now, I always considered school to be little more
            than a place to eat lunch and play sport. <br /><br />
            But recalling those rare moments of focus in the classroom, I remain
            indebted to an early English teacher who encouraged me to write and
            write often. Now, alongside a working career which has encompassed the
            full gamut from the shearing shed to an abattoir floor, in small
            business, to executive management at a global Fortune 500 company, and
            being at the ground floor of an exciting dental tech start-up, I am
            fortunate enough to be able to pursue a writing career. <br /><br />
            That this comprises two discrete audiences is perhaps unusual, but
            whatever the trigger for you visiting this site, please feel free to
            explore the ‘other side of my writing; whichever one that may be. I am
            extremely appreciative of all those who helped me become established
            as a rugby writer, and likewise for everyone who continues to support
            my fiction writing. But most of all I want to thank my readers: time
            is valuable and the fact that you have chosen to give some of yours
            over to my writing is humbly and warmly acknowledged.
