              "A missing woman . . . a townful of suspects. The haunting debut
              crime novel that transports the reader back to the 1980s and a
              small rural town in New Zealand. ‘She wasn’t the first and she
              wouldn’t be the last; swallowed into the deep, dark recesses of
              the King Country bush, never to be seen again.’ It’s January 1983.
              During his university summer break, Ryan Bradley returns to the
              remote town of Nashville in New Zealand’s rugged King Country.
              It’s a bittersweet trip: he’s working long, punishing hours as a
              woolpresser, he needs to sell his late mother’s house, and he’s
              increasingly feeling like an outcast in his childhood town. But
              mostly he’s haunted by memories of Sanna Sovernen, a Finnish
              backpacker and his secret lover, who worked with him in the
              shearing shed the summer before - then vanished without trace. Now
              Sanna’s sister Emilia has arrived from Finland, determined to get
              answers - and as he’s the workmate who reported Sanna missing, she
              wants Ryan’s help. Because Emilia knows her sister was not the
              first female traveller in the area to disappear . . ."
