            </p>
            <p>
              In November 2023, the Melbourne Rebels began a pre-season full of
              hope and optimism. With a feep roster and a strog, unifying
              'Ubunta' culture embedding itself with the franchise, there was
              high anticipation that the 2024 season - their 14th - would
              finally deliver success. <br />
              <br />
              Granted unprecdented insider access, writer Geoff Parkes set out
              to document the Rebels' season and to provide rugby insight into
              what makes a professional rugby franchise work. What followed was
              an extraordinary turn of events: the club tipped into voluntary
              administration early in 2024, now not only fighting to compete in
              one of the global rugby's toughest elist competitions, but against
              a governing body intent on shutting it down. <br />
              <br />
              A year in the Life and Death of the Melbourne Rebels is a raw,
              close up account of a group of special people who, despite being
              forced to operate under severe financial and emotional stress,
              strove to take their club to it's first ever Super Rugby finals
              appearance. This book also provides a a window into the
              administration of rugby in Australia; a troubling account of how a
              determinatio to impose financial austerity clashed head on with
              rugby's traditional values of respect, comradeship, and a shared
              love of the game.

              Power and influence in rugby is shifting away from its historical
              tie to international on-field success, much of it in the southern
              hemisphere, to the boardrooms of cashed-up, influential rugby
              clubs in the UK and France. <br />
              <br />A confused rugby calendar is subjected to a ‘land grab’ from
              clubs and national unions, all striving to maximise revenue.
              Player welfare concerns are cited by all and sundry, yet are cast
              aside as soon as there is a dollar to be made. <br />
              <br />Told through the eyes of rugby identities from around the
              world, this is a fascinating story of a once staunchly amateur
              sport now fully engulfed in the clutches of professionalism—the
              future uncertain and the fabric of ‘the game they play in heaven’
              straining under the excesses and ambitions of rugby’s new
              powerbrokers.
